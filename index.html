<h1> I have a website </h1>
(it's really cool but I haven't watched the css tutorial so it's pretty weird looking at the moment)
<p> I'm gonna try to add an image </p>
<img src = "clyde...PNG" alt = "it didn't work"> 
<br>
<form>
  <div>
    <label> YOU CAN TYPE HERE </label>
    <input type="text" name="idk">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label> (you can type here too) </label>
    <input type="text" name="whatever">
  </div>
</form>
